  canonical `Cut` for "component under test"

* Blazor: Synchronization in `Navigate()` and `Refresh()` now with the same
  arguments as `Click()` with int `expectRenders` instead of bool `expectRender`
  (breaking change)

* Blazor: Support the `?clear=true` GET argument to clear the storage

* WebForms and Core examples: Internet Explorer has been forcibly disabled by
  Microsoft, thus remove it from old tests
